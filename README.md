# lab_repoter
This project is a part of a lab report generator. It was built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern for better organization and maintainability. The goal is to provide a systematic methodology that will make future changes to the codebase easier. 


The codebase is organized into three components: model, view, and controller. The model class manages data from a variety of sources, including files and databases. The view component creates the user interface (UI), while the controller class functions as a bridge between the model and view objects, allowing them to communicate and coordinate with one another.


This project was created with Python 3.12.1. I used a virtual environment to separate the libraries used in this project from those used in previous projects. The prerequisites package allows you to install the libraries you need for this project. The file holding the list of required packages is called requirements.txt.


The application's main target is Windows. The completed code script was compiled into an executable file with PyInstaller, allowing for easy distribution and use on the Windows platform.
